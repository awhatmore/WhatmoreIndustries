      <p>
        This system proposes a wearable, non-invasive band capable of detecting subtle chemical changes in arterial blood composition using multispectral light transmission and reflectance. By emitting controlled wavelengths of light across the optical window of human tissue (e.g., near-infrared to shortwave infrared), and measuring spectral absorption and scattering on the other side, it is possible to analyze biomarkers in blood dynamically.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system leverages arterial pulse timing to synchronize signal acquisition with peak blood flow, ensuring measurement accuracy in high-flow regions. Wavelengths are tuned to capture data on glucose, oxygen saturation, lipids, hydration levels, and even emerging metabolic byproductsâ€”such as advanced glycation end products or oxidative markers.
      </p>
      <p>
        This enables real-time feedback on how ingested substances, medications, or environmental toxins alter internal biochemistry. Users would be able to wear the band continuously and observe changes in waveform composition immediately after meals or environmental exposure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Future development may combine photonic sensors with machine learning models trained on spectral profiles, allowing the system to self-calibrate and improve in accuracy over time. With further miniaturization, this technology has the potential to transform preventative healthcare, nutritional testing, and even mental health tracking.
