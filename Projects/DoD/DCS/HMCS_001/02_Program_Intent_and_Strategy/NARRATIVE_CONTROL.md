# CPAS-001 — Narrative & Positioning Control

## Canonical Identity

CPAS-001 is a **real-time human-perceptual translation system for aircraft state.**

It translates complex, fast-changing aircraft dynamics into intuitive human perception, freeing cognitive load for combat.

---

## Problem Class Ownership

CPAS-001 owns the problem of:

**Human interaction with high-dimensional, time-critical dynamic systems under extreme cognitive load.**

It does not compete as a display.
It competes as a cognitive system.

---

## What CPAS-001 Is

- a human-state translation layer  
- a perceptual compression system  
- a cognitive performance stabilizer  
- a dynamic combat state interpreter  
- a survivability and lethality multiplier  
- a training compression system  

---

## What CPAS-001 Is Not

CPAS-001 is NOT described as:

- a HUD skin  
- an overlay  
- avionics  
- a visualization system  
- a telemetry display  
- a flight sim mod  
- a pilot aid  
- a training toy  
- an interface tweak  

These terms collapse its problem class and destroy valuation.

## Allowed Language

- translation  
- perception  
- human state  
- dynamic state  
- cognitive load  
- compression  
- real-time  
- survivability  
- performance envelope  
- geometry-energy cognition  
- human-machine coupling  

---

## Dangerous Language

Avoid:

- “just shows”  
- “basically displays”  
- “kind of like a HUD”  
- “overlay”  
- “game”  
- “UI mod”  
- “helpful indicators”  

These reframe the system into commodity categories.

---

## Claim Discipline

CPAS-001 never claims:

- replacement of pilots  
- autonomy  
- decision authority  
- guaranteed outcomes  
- magic or intuition

CPAS-001 always claims:

- translation  
- support of human authority  
- performance stabilization  
- cognitive load reduction  
- safety boundedness  

---

## Demonstration Framing

Demonstrations are framed as:

“human performance transformation under dynamic load”

Not:

“features”
“tools”
“widgets”
“stats”

---

## Narrative Escalation Rule

If a description makes CPAS-001 sound smaller than it is,  
the description is wrong.

The language must rise to meet the problem class.
