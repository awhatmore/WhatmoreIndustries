# Development Record Entry
Date: 2026-01-24
Context: Day 1 Logging
Location / Environment: Home Trailer

## Situation
The situation has come to the point where structureal logging needs to be taken more seriously. This 
  augment appears to be legitimately valuable and it's not worth keeping it as a hobbie heads up display
  or giving it to the community first before allowing the DoD an opportunity to take it before exposed to
  the public. Will create github (whatmore industries .io) log of all that's to come and all that is 
  happening.

## Observations
Being very new to flight simulation and able to have used my engineering background to discern the need 
  an augment, I knew roughly what I needed and where I wanted it to go. Using specific energy to derive
  a notion of whether my actions were gaining energy, removing energy, or holding steady. The F-16 AI
  opponent in DCS is extremely disciplined, and in order to beat it, I would need to outperform it. 

From my observations, the performance set up looked like this:

- F-16 AI pilot keeps 99% throttle (mine at the time was 102%)
- F-16 AI pilot maintains 444 ish knots (I couldn't maintain a speed regardless of anything I did)
- I would never beat the AI to the turn around (we would alwawys end up face to face)
- In a turn I would always end up seeing the opponent go further and further upward
- Even if we were equal in a turn, the AI would be able to take shots on me way before even making a
  full turn to my rear where you would generally begin evasive maneuvers
- The F-16 AI appeared superior to all other jets by far
- The F-16 in my mind may actually be superior to other fighters in that it can control its fight. Other
  aircraft may have better turn radius and speed increase, but within the conditions of the F-16, it
  appears that there may be a design perk that puts the F-16 in a best of one world, and that one world,
  the F-16 isis in complete control.
-"If" the F-16 isn't this concept, then there really wouldn't be much use for it at all in production,
  so I decided to assume that, with the observations of the AI aircraft's clear superior capability
  under certain conditions, in which those conditions were difficult to control from outside those
  conditions, "if" I can create a way to "see" where I'm losing, where I'm gaining, I can see if it's
  possible to defeat the AI by utilizing onboard-available information. If so, I can use this for personal
  use
- The human player F-16 experience appears extraordinarily difficult to control in a positive energy state
- If I turned too hard, I lose momentum and have no speed or turn
- I saw that I needed to create a guage that shows energy gain, loss and stabilization

## Outcomes
Beyond undefeatable. Impossible to not get a kill on F-16 AI Ace difficulty. Constantly target coming 
  into sight. Opponent losing altitude while attempting to match my aircraft's energy state

Able to take on 16 Mig-23 Ace difficulty with guns only. Somewhat easily down between 6 and 9 targets 
  before running out of fuel.

## Signals & Metrics (if available)
(Telemetry, values, screenshots, tracks, plots, logs.)

## Constraints Discovered
 Only get shot down when not maintaining full performance of aircfraft or
  not taking high opportunity targets. If chase too straight, a Mig will line up a shot. When holding 
  fuel tanks in an attempt to elongate the fight, performance is not able to stay alive

2026-01-24 Will continue. I'm tired...

## Insights
(What this implies about the human-machine problem.)

## Design Implications
(What HMCS must encode, change, protect, or enable.)

## Follow-on Questions
(What to test next. What to watch for. What to isolate.)
