# Development Record Entry
Date: 2026-01-24
Context: Day 1 Logging
Location / Environment: Home Trailer

## Situation
The situation has come to the point where structureal logging needs to be taken more seriously. This 
  augment appears to be legitimately valuable and it's not worth keeping it as a hobbie heads up display
  or giving it to the community first before allowing the DoD an opportunity to take it before exposed to
  the public. Will create github (whatmore industries .io) log of all that's to come and all that is 
  happening.

## Observations
Being very new to flight simulation and able to have used my engineering background to discern the need 
  an augment, I knew roughly what I needed and where I wanted it to go. Using specific energy to derive
  a notion of whether my actions were gaining energy, removing energy, or holding steady. The F-16 AI
  opponent in DCS is extremely disciplined, and in order to beat it, I would need to outperform it. 

From my observations, the performance set up looked like this:

- F-16 AI pilot keeps 99% throttle (mine at the time was 102%)
- F-16 AI pilot maintains 444 ish knots (I couldn't maintain a speed regardless of anything I did)
- I would never beat the AI to the turn around (we would alwawys end up face to face)
- In a turn I would always end up seeing the opponent go further and further upward
- Even if we were equal in a turn, the AI would be able to take shots on me way before even making a
  full turn to my rear where you would generally begin evasive maneuvers
- The F-16 AI appeared superior to all other jets by far
- The F-16 in my mind may actually be superior to other fighters in that it can control its fight. Other
  aircraft may have better turn radius and speed increase, but within the conditions of the F-16, it
  appears that there may be a design perk that puts the F-16 in a best of one world, and that one world,
  the F-16 isis in complete control.
-"If" the F-16 isn't this concept, then there really wouldn't be much use for it at all in production,
  so I decided to assume that, with the observations of the AI aircraft's clear superior capability
  under certain conditions, in which those conditions were difficult to control from outside those
  conditions, "if" I can create a way to "see" where I'm losing, where I'm gaining, I can see if it's
  possible to defeat the AI by utilizing onboard-available information. If so, I can use this for personal
  use
- The human player F-16 experience appears extraordinarily difficult to control in a positive energy state
- If I turned too hard, I lose momentum and have no speed or turn
- I saw that I needed to create a guage that shows energy gain, loss and stabilization

## Outcomes
Beyond undefeatable. Impossible to not get a kill on F-16 AI Ace difficulty. Constantly target coming 
  into sight. Opponent losing altitude while attempting to match my aircraft's energy state

Able to take on 16 Mig-23 Ace difficulty with guns only. Somewhat easily down between 6 and 9 targets 
  before running out of fuel.

## Signals & Metrics (if available)
(Telemetry, values, screenshots, tracks, plots, logs.)

## Constraints Discovered
 Only get shot down when not maintaining full performance of aircfraft or
  not taking high opportunity targets. If chase too straight, a Mig will line up a shot. When holding 
  fuel tanks in an attempt to elongate the fight, performance is not able to stay alive

2026-01-24 Late evening  Continued ...

## Insights
The significant difference between performance of a low experienced pilot to becoming capable to extreme 
  high survival in the sky and extraordinarily imporved lethal capability makes the path of pursuing this
  augment imparative and must be handeled with great care and professionalism. DoD will have first access
  in the decision on what happens to this augment and must have first access before any public access
  is considered.

## Design Implications
HMCS Augment 001 by Whatmore Industries must, in order to fulfill the apabilities of survivability, training 
  cost reduction, safetey to human life and government property, combat lethality, maximum aitcraft 
  performance extraction, etc., calculate specific energy, relay to the pilot whether they are losing,
  gaining or maintaining in ft/s, and corelate that to turn rate, in degrees per second, while displaying
  their air speed. 

These figures need to be displayed where the pilot can constantly and consistently reference them in a 
  turn whithout hindering ability to track the target, aim the weapon systems, aquire a lock, or search 
  for targets. It may need to be toggled on and off if needed depending on the circumstances.

## Follow-on Questions
What's next for HMCS Augment 001. Next, I will look at all lines DCS exports that can enable me to continue 
  adding augment potential to the pilot. I will be looking at missile reaction augments and missile dodging
  factors.

## Follow up Notes and Remarks
This project took a total elapsed time of 12 days to complete. Having no idea gow DCS exports data, what 
  data we need, and with the beginning understanding of all plans that will unfold. The project went from
  playground to pre-Alpha demonstration phase in 12 days.

## Explanations of creations

create_hmcs_structure.bat
This bat was created to create the detailed folder structure so it saved time and removed human error

README.md
This readme was to honor the structure and create an explanative document so an outsider can understand
  the context of the layout

00_README
This is a more detailed readme as core readme

01_Development_Record
This is to create a place for the words and ideas to be placed in as a raw timeline of development 
  information and processes


02_Program_Intent_and_Strategy
This is going to house the deep dive and strategic work on deliverables and plans for implamentation
  and move to market

03_Shallow_Demonstration_Package
This is going to house the work on the low level exposure product

04_Deep_Demonstration_Package
This will house the expanded work on the exposure product

05_Test_and_Validation
This will house all the testing data, files, demonstrationables, and testing or validation plans
  and presentations

06_Legal_and_Rights
This will house all of the work from the attorney

07_Implementation_and_Integration
This is where the plans and record of how to integrate, how to implament once that stage has begun

08_Human_Factors_and_Safety
This will house parts of the project that will become important once a solid product has been met.
  Human factors and safety will be at highest importance every time a phase is passed into fruition.
  Once a phase has been succeeded, human factors will be responsible for making sure everything works
  within expected limits and does not hinder a pilots ability to perform safely in the air. 
  Subsequently, there will always be an off switch that will allow the pilot to override our augment
  in order to protect against any safety concerns if there was a fault in the software. This section
  is also there to prove how seriousy and maturely this company will handle the safety, human impact
  and potential complications that can arrise and how dangerous those can be. With that in mind, the 
  product will ALWAYS be removable at any time from view in order to protect the human, assets, and 
  human life.

09_Evidence_Archive
This will house evidence on performance, technical, test, interation, legal
