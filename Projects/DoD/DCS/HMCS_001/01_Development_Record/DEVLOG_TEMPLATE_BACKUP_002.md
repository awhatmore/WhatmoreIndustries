## Intent

(Why you were working. What you were trying to understand, fix, or achieve.)

---

## Situation

(What was happening. Scenario. Conditions. Aircraft. Opponents. Configuration. Mental state if relevant.)

---

## Actions Taken

(What you actually did. Changes. Tests. Experiments. Flights. Builds. Adjustments.)

---

## Observations

(What you noticed. What surprised you. What consistently happened. What didn’t behave as expected.)

---

## Outcomes

(Performance shifts, survivability, lethality, failures, limitations, emergent behaviors.)

---

## Signals & Metrics

(Telemetry, values, screenshots, tracks, logs, plots, recordings, notes.)

---

## Constraints Discovered

(New limits. Human limits. Aircraft limits. Interface limits. Energy limits. Safety boundaries.)

---

## Insights

(What this implies about the human-machine problem. What became clearer. What changed in your understanding.)

---

## Design Implications

(What HMCS must encode, translate, protect, enable, prevent, or reshape.)

---

## Risk & Sensitivity Notes

(Anything that feels strategically sensitive, safety-critical, or exposure-relevant.)

---

## Follow-On Questions

(What this demands you test next. What is now uncertain. What opened.)

---

## Linked Artifacts

(Files, videos, plots, commits, test cases, screenshots.)

---

## Remarks

(Anything that doesn’t fit but matters.)
