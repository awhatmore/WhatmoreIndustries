📘 HMCS_001 — Program Documentation Repository
Human–Machine Combat Symbology | Program Record & Operations Spine

Overview
This repository is the official documentation backbone for the HMCS_001 program.
It exists to maintain:

Proof of development
Strategic and technical continuity
Legal and rights protection posture
Controlled demonstration pathways
Test and validation structure
Narrative and positioning control

This is not a casual notes repository.
It is a program record system.
Everything placed here supports one or more of the following:

invention provenance
technical memory
demonstration readiness
legal defensibility
evaluation credibility


Program Intent
HMCS_001 is a human–machine combat symbology and state-representation program focused on improving:

perceptual compression
engagement comprehension
energy and geometry awareness
cognitive efficiency under dynamic conditions

The program treats symbology not as “display,” but as a control-relevant interface layer between physical state, predictive modeling, and human decision-making.
This repository does not host the product.
It hosts the program.

Repository Role
This repository serves as the controlled source of truth for:

what has been built
why it exists
how it is tested
how it is demonstrated
how it is protected
how it is positioned

All serious development artifacts are reflected here in structured form.

Each directory represents a formal program artifact class.
Nothing enters the program without belonging to one.

Artifact Definitions
01 — Development Record
Chronological, factual log of work performed.
Purpose:

proof of invention
technical memory
evolution tracking
legal leverage

Includes:

dated entries
problems addressed
changes made
rationale
observed outcomes
screenshots, plots, clips
insights

This is the spine of the program.

02 — Program Intent & Strategy
Defines the mission, scope, and long-term positioning.
Purpose:

prevent trajectory drift
align collaborators
guide legal and partnership framing


03 — Shallow Demonstration Package
Decision-layer material.
Purpose:

fast comprehension
pilot / manager / investor communication
conceptual clarity

Avoids internals.

04 — Deep Demonstration Package
Engineering and evaluator layer.
Purpose:

technical credibility
architecture explanation
performance rationale
limitation transparency


05 — Test & Validation
Turns demonstrations into evidence.
Purpose:

repeatability
metrics
pilot feedback structure
iteration discipline


06 — Legal & Rights
Operational protection framework.
Purpose:

prevent accidental loss
maintain leverage
prepare for external engagement


07 — Implementation & Integration
Real-world pathways.
Purpose:

simulator integration concepts
live platform concepts
training pathways
system boundaries


08 — Human Factors & Safety
Evaluation-critical layer.
Purpose:

cognitive load analysis
failure behavior
misleading cue analysis
authority philosophy
training interface


09 — Evidence Archive
Supporting proof base.
Purpose:

credibility
legal backing
demonstration strength

Includes:

videos
plots
before/after engagements
logs
versioned builds


10 — Narrative & Positioning
Language control.
Purpose:

prevent misclassification
protect strategic value
align messaging

Defines:

what this is
what it is not
what it owns
what is never claimed


11 — Future Roadmap
Controlled expansion.
Purpose:

longevity
funding credibility
domain protection


12 — Counter-Suggestion & Trajectory Control
Governance and immune system.
Purpose:

structured handling of external requests
prevention of silent redirection
rights and narrative protection
formal realignment procedure

Defines how counter-proposals are logged, evaluated, accepted, deferred, or rejected.

Behavioral Rules

Nothing significant is built without being reflected in the Development Record.
No demonstration evolves without test framing.
No trajectory change occurs without documentation updates.
No counter-direction is accepted without formal review.
This repository is cumulative, not casual.


Status
This repository is under active construction.
Artifacts will mature from v0.x working documents into formalized program records.

Authorship & Control
This repository represents the official internal documentation system for HMCS_001.
External access does not imply permission to:

replicate
integrate
demonstrate
or represent

without explicit authorization and legal framing.
