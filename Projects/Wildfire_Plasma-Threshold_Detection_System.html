      <div class="subtitle">Overview</div>
      <p>
        This proposal outlines a drone-deployed thermal monitoring system designed for proactive wildfire prevention and rapid hotspot mitigation. The system leverages a network of autonomous aerial drones equipped with high-resolution thermal cameras and on-board anomaly detection. The privacy-respecting design ensures data collection is strictly limited to plasma-level temperature events, eliminating the risk of personal or non-fire-related data capture.

      <h2>System Design and Operational Logic</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Thermal Sensing:</b> Drones perform routine grid sweeps at altitude, scanning for temperatures indicative of active combustion and plasma events.</li>
        <li><b>Plasma-Threshold Detection:</b> On-board algorithms continuously analyze thermal data, flagging only those signals that exceed the established temperature required for plasma formation.</li>
        <li><b>Privacy-First Policy:</b> The system is incapable of resolving features, people, or vehicles; it only triggers on thermal events that meet or exceed the plasma threshold, preserving the privacy of all non-relevant ground activity.</li>
        <li><b>Autonomous Anomaly Analysis:</b> Each drone stores and compares current scans with previous flight data, detecting new or expanding hotspots and minimizing false positives from non-fire heat sources.</li>
        <li><b>Alert and Mitigation:</b> When a qualifying hotspot is detected, the drone relays the geocoordinates and intensity data to the central command platform. This information can be used to trigger immediate ground or aerial suppression response, or automated deployment of fire-retardant drone units.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Advantages Over Satellite-Only Systems</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Rapid Detection:</b> Drones provide update intervals measured in minutes, compared to the hours-long revisit times of satellite platforms.</li>
        <li><b>High Spatial Resolution:</b> Targeted drone flights achieve higher granularity and sensitivity for early-stage fire identification and tracking.</li>
        <li><b>Scalable Network:</b> Additional drones can be deployed to match terrain complexity, risk level, or evolving threat areas.</li>
        <li><b>All-Weather Capability:</b> Low-altitude drone operations are less affected by cloud cover than orbital platforms, improving reliability in challenging conditions.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Implementation Roadmap</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Phase 1:</b> Develop proof-of-concept with fixed-route drone patrols and basic plasma-threshold anomaly detection.</li>
        <li><b>Phase 2:</b> Integrate on-board storage and cloud-based anomaly correlation to refine detection accuracy.</li>
        <li><b>Phase 3:</b> Enable live reporting to central command dashboard, with integration to existing fire mapping and resource dispatch platforms.</li>
        <li><b>Phase 4:</b> Expand the fleet, optimize coverage patterns, and deploy automated suppression payloads in response to verified plasma-level events.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        This system establishes a new standard for wildfire prevention and early mitigation, offering cities and land agencies a privacy-forward, high-precision tool to identify and respond to emergent fire threats well before they reach crisis scale. By focusing exclusively on plasma-threshold events, the platform ensures both operational effectiveness and the highest level of public trust.
