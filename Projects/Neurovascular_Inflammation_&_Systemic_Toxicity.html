      This page explores the connection between liver function, blood toxicity, and brain inflammation. The central hypothesis is that headaches and neurological symptoms may be early indicators of systemic overload—particularly when the liver struggles to detoxify circulating compounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proposed system includes real-time spectral analysis of blood flowing directly from the heart, allowing for the detection of immediate chemical shifts (e.g., post-ingestion of food or exposure to environmental agents). Patterns in these changes may correlate with symptom onset, enabling earlier interventions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Future experimentation may involve an external circulatory module—a kind of portable "artificial liver"—designed to filter blood outside the body and reintroduce it in real time. If headache relief coincides with blood purification, this would validate the system’s diagnostic and therapeutic potential.

      This theory bridges fields including neurology, toxicology, hemodynamics, and personalized medicine. It opens the door to individualized environmental response tracking and novel treatments for chronic neurological symptoms.
