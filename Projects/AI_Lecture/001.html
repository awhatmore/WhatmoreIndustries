<h1>AI Technologist Lecture Notes</h1>
<br>
<p>Most academic lecturers they teach backwards. They teach from the knowledge of what people already discovered. They don't teach the process, how they did it, what the process was like. Biography.</p>
<br>
<p>This process is to open the mind. Thought process. Not item specific. Specific item of this lecture is the html I created. I'm not teaching the html creation. I'm teaching the process of using the AI to solve your problem.</p>
<br>
<p>For your to be able to use things in your own way. But it's also important to use html and for the specific reason of note taking, story boarding, project outlines, proposals, road maps. Investors, lectures, documentation, keeping thoughts together, HELPS THE AI BE ABLE TO USE OLD DATA FOR NEW ANALYSIS.</p>
<br>
<p>AI new analysis, meaning need a new chat or you want to bring up a previously worked on idea and you want to maintain the integrity of the information in that project so the AI can best analyze what was discussed in the previous project. (COPY PASTE) OR URL</p>
