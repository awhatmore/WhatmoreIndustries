      This concept outlines a real-time blood analysis and detoxification system designed to operate outside the body while maintaining live circulation. Blood would be extracted through a vein or artery, passed through a monitoring module, filtered through a synthetic purification process, and returned to the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monitoring would rely on spectral analysis and fluidic biomarkers to detect deviations in chemical composition, with a focus on early indicators of systemic inflammation, toxicity, or dietary reactivity. This includes detecting rapid spikes in compounds like histamines, ammonia, or metabolic byproducts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Purification would involve custom-engineered membranes or resin-based cartridges that selectively bind and remove unwanted compounds, much like a hybrid of dialysis and liver enzyme activity. The filtration process would be intelligent, adapting to real-time data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is to provide immediate feedback to the user while offering potential relief from toxin-related symptoms—such as headaches, fatigue, or cognitive fog—by proving causality between purification and recovery. This system may also support long-term health optimization through detailed personal data logs.
