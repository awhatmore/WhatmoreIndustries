    <h1>Submarine Drone Antenna Array</h1>
    <div class="accent">
      <p><strong>"When satellites are too far and ocean storms rage, let the sea itself become your signal."</strong></p>
      <p>A novel concept for a flexible, directional, and reconfigurable VLF antenna network using tethered underwater drones.</p>
    </div>

    <section>
      <h2>Concept Overview</h2>
      <p>This system proposes using a fleet of underwater drones that act not just as carriers of an antenna, but as the antenna itself. By maintaining specific synchronized positions underwater, the drones form a functional VLF (Very Low Frequency) antenna array capable of directional communication — potentially even while submerged in treacherous ocean conditions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Key Design Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Drone-Based Geometry:</strong> Drones are arranged in a predefined shape — such as a ring or elongated array — which allows for beamforming and directional broadcast/reception.</li>
        <li><strong>Neutrally Buoyant Configuration:</strong> Each drone can maintain a constant depth just below surface turbulence. This helps stability without breaking stealth.</li>
        <li><strong>Tethered Control Hub:</strong> All drones are linked to a central control drone or sub that controls geometry and synchronizes signal timing.</li>
        <li><strong>No Propellers, Only Fins:</strong> Motion and position adjustment is performed by quiet fin propulsion to minimize acoustic signature.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Operational Advantage</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Directional VLF Communication:</strong> Traditional VLF antennas are massive and omnidirectional. This system allows shaping the beam, pointing communication toward a sub or satellite relay more effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Stealth in Chaos:</strong> During storms and high-seas interference, conventional transmission becomes unstable. This system thrives in those moments — using chaotic surface noise as cover.</li>
        <li><strong>Modular and Scalable:</strong> The system can operate with as few as 6 drones and scale up for wider coverage or higher signal integrity.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Implementation Options</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Full-Wire Ring Alternative:</strong> Instead of drones as antennas, drones can extend and form a circular structure with embedded buoyant VLF wire. The air-filled dielectric helps match impedance while maintaining near-surface altitude.</li>
        <li><strong>3D Configuration:</strong> Forming spiral or layered array patterns can allow hybrid VLF/ELF transmission properties.</li>
        <li><strong>Active Beam Shaping:</strong> Use synchronized phase modulation to direct lobes toward submarines or satellites.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Passive reception for stealth mode communication and fleet triangulation.</li>
        <li>Surface-sensor integration for storm utilization, power harvesting, and burst transmission windows.</li>
        <li>AI-based swarm reconfiguration to optimize geometry in real-time for best SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
      <p>Submarines need a communication strategy that isn't bound by satellite visibility or the need to surface. Using reconfigurable underwater antennas lets them whisper across vast distances even during the most hostile sea states — when the ocean is loudest and cover is deepest.</p>
