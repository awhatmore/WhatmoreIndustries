    <h1>Time-Entropy Interaction Theory (TEIT)</h1>
    <div class="accent">
      <p><strong>“Time is not merely a passive, linear backdrop to physical events.”</strong></p>
      <p>In TEIT, time is understood as a directional gradient — an active agent, channeled through entropy, that interacts with matter and space to create observable effects such as gravity, heat, and quantum oscillation.</p>
    </div>
     <section>
    <h2>Core Hypothesis</h2>
    <p>Entropy is the vector through which time transfers its flux into matter. When matter exists without entropy (e.g., near 0 Kelvin), it ceases to experience the flow of time — it is frozen, not just thermally but temporally. The interaction of matter and entropy creates time dilation, gravitational influence, and radiant emission (e.g., stars).</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Time is a 1D river. Matter placed in it experiences oscillatory impacts (entropy events), which manifest as time.</li>
      <li>Gravity results from high entropy density causing time to "curve" or slow.</li>
      <li>The sun's gravity and emission are due not just to mass but to high entropy exchange — time flowing into matter.</li>
      <li>Far objects (low entropy emitters) act more like recipients of time/gravity (like children), while active sources like stars (parents) emit influence.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Experimental Strategy: Laser Containment as a Gateway</h2>
    <p>Developing a means of containing high-energy laser light offers a test bed for observing localized time dilation effects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Contained light has zero rest mass but high energy — a focused entropy source.</li>
      <li>Surrounding this containment with gravitational and temporal sensors may detect minute curvature of space-time.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Path to Space-Based Validation</h2>
    <p>Because Earth's background gravity overwhelms subtle effects, future tests must occur in low-gravity environments:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Isolated vacuum chamber experiments onboard orbital platforms.</li>
      <li>Use of cryogenic shielding to test behavior near 0 K.</li>
      <li>Measurement of entropy/time flow as gravity field in absence of significant mass.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Applications & Implications</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A new approach to understanding black holes as entropy sinks rather than purely mass-based attractors.</li>
      <li>Potential to bridge gaps between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics.</li>
      <li>May lead to breakthroughs in propulsion, timekeeping, and energy systems based on entropy flow.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Finalize theoretical structure and language.</li>
      <li>Publish website explaining TEIT and roadmap.</li>
      <li>Begin materials testing for high-energy light containment.</li>
      <li>Develop space-qualified sensor platforms for entropy/timescale measurements.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p>This theory suggests that time, gravity, and radiation are all manifestations of entropy's interaction with matter. With precise containment of entropy (e.g., light), we may begin shaping our understanding of time itself — not as a dimension, but as a river whose flow carves out the landscape of physical reality.</p>
  </section>

    <h2>Why TEIT?</h2>
    <p>TEIT offers a potential explanation for phenomena current physics doesn't fully resolve — such as the source of gravitational fields, the link between entropy and time dilation, and the active role of matter in shaping the flow of time.</p>

    <h2>Experimental Path Forward</h2>
    <p>By developing a laser containment system and eventually testing entropy-based effects on gravitational sensors in space, we may uncover relationships between temperature, mass, time gradients, and localized spacetime warping.</p>
