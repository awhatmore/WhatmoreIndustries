# Session 1 — Foundation & Direction

---

## 1. Capabilities (Reality Check)

### What Alex Can Do
- Create programs, automation, tools, and full systems  
- Rapidly prototype ideas into working solutions  
- Solve problems end-to-end (concept → execution)

> **Core truth:** Capability is not the bottleneck.  
> Direction, leverage, and focus are.

---

## 2. Immediate Research / Action Items

### Things for Alex to Investigate
- **Vibration / haptics**
  - Game immersion
  - Engagement or feedback applications
- **Facebook livestream guidelines**
  - Official rules vs real-world enforcement
  - Practical workarounds
  - Algorithm behavior (time, consistency, thumbnails)

---

## 3. Core Operating Philosophy

### What to Do
- Anything that stops us → **become an expert in it**
- Resistance is a signal, not a blocker
- Separation exists between:
  - Where we are now
  - Where we want to be

**Goal:** Close that gap intentionally.

---

## 4. Acceleration Strategy

### How Do We Accelerate?
- **AI**
  - Automation
  - Content refinement
  - Editing and summarization
- **Coaching / Networking**
  - Learning faster by leveraging others
  - Helping others to build influence and trust

---

## 5. Defining “Streamer” (Our Version)

### What a Streamer Is (Not Just an Influencer)
- Influencer: partial overlap
- **Core traits**
  - Authentic
  - Transparent
  - Purpose-driven

### Moral Position
- Preaching morality without preaching
- Playing **for those who can’t play**
  - *Backseat General* meaning
- Team-based thinking as a primary focus

---

## 6. Audience Capture & Retention

### Attention Is the Battlefield
- Capture attention quickly
- Maintain attention deliberately
- Get to the point

### Methods
- Technology-assisted digestibility
- Separate content types:
  - **Live streams** (long-form, presence)
  - **Funny / creative clips** (short-form, viral)

---

# Live Streaming Strategy

## 7. Live Stream Problems
- Finished live streams are often too short
  - Under 10 minutes (sometimes ~5 minutes)
- Inconsistent output
- Needs automation

---

## 8. Automating Live Streams  
*(Build on what already works)*

### Facebook Requirements (Practical)
- Individual streams: **5–10 minutes minimum**
- Total streaming time:
  - ~4 hours every 2 weeks
- Consistency matters more than perfection

---

## 9. Beating the System (Without Breaking Rules)

### Controlled Workflow
- **Pre-recorded “live” segment** (temporary)
- **AI-generated intro** (to test)
- **Live stream from a separate computer**

### Two Possible Outcomes
1. AI creates a better, shorter standalone video
2. AI-generated intro becomes the thumbnail anchor

---

## 10. Homework Assignments

### Alex’s Homework
- Explore a **vibration-based game or app**
  - Engagement
  - Feedback
  - Immersion potential

### Your Homework
- Research VR streamers who:
  - Show their full setup
  - Are technically complex (not surface-level)
- Study:
  - **Butterfly farm / flying garden videos**
    - Calm
    - Visually engaging
    - Loop-friendly

---

## 11. Technical Notes

### Video
- Resolution
- Wide-angle capture (Alex)
- Record full-screen at high quality
- Share raw footage with Alex
- Alex handles scaling and formatting

### Known Issues
- Desynced audio
  - YouTube and Facebook-specific problems

---

## 12. Butterfly Farm Notes (Future Concept)

### Heating Options
- **Vevor diesel heater**
  - ~$300
- **Propane heater** (future upgrade)
  - ~$1200
  - Higher cost, cleaner integration

---

> **Closing Thought:**  
> Anything pushing back on us is defining the mission.  
> Master the resistance, and acceleration follows.
