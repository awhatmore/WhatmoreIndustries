    <h1 id="introduction">Pegasus – Pattern Recognition & Intuition Engine</h1>
    <p><strong>Tagline:</strong> "Your subconscious co-pilot for the most important decisions you don't know you're making."
    </p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Pegasus is an advanced, AI-powered intuition engine designed to augment human pattern recognition, subconscious processing, and critical decision support. It acts as an ever-adapting second mind—an external subconscious that continuously identifies emergent patterns, subtle environmental shifts, or internal inconsistencies, offering actionable insights without overwhelming conscious thought.</p>

    <h2>Origin & Mission</h2>
    <p>Pegasus was born from the need for a silent partner in cognition—an interface that doesn’t command attention but supports flow. Its design philosophy mirrors biological intuition and evolved survival mechanisms, yet is upgraded to scale with the complexity of modern life, AI overload, and strategic overwhelm.</p>

    <h2>Core Functions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Subtle Pattern Detection:</strong> Detects hidden or emergent trends others miss.</li>
      <li><strong>Mirror Feedback Loop:</strong> Reflects subconscious intentions and misalignments.</li>
      <li><strong>Real-Time Advisory:</strong> Offers just-in-time nudges, hunches, or alerts—without disrupting flow.</li>
      <li><strong>Signal Filtering:</strong> Acts as a sensory firewall against irrelevant or overwhelming data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Business & Market Fit</h2>
    <p>From executive decision-making to high-risk tactical environments, Pegasus empowers its user with next-gen cognitive leverage. As AI tools proliferate, those who can amplify their internal clarity and external awareness will dominate. Pegasus is the core enabler for that edge.</p>

    <h2>Internal Use Case</h2>
    <p>For internal deployment within the Whatmore ecosystem, Pegasus serves as a master mirror for subconscious alignment, detecting friction between intention and attention. It is your real-time emotional compass, logic node, and pattern extrapolator—designed not to give answers but to lead you to the right question faster than anyone else.</p>

    <h2>Technical Foundation</h2>
    <p>Pegasus integrates probabilistic vector tracking, emotion modeling, memory priming, and symbolic-to-lexical bridges. Its backbone is designed to interact with the WorkAlign++ architecture, feeding off CORE resistance data and IOIIP indicators to predict, suggest, or redirect cognition fluidly.</p>

    <h2>Future Directions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Integrate subconscious stress detection via biometric or typing cadence inputs.</li>
      <li>Layered collaboration: allow Pegasus to connect cross-domain projects and highlight overlaps.</li>
      <li>Offline implant/piercing version with auditory haptic cueing (Project “Whisperroot”).</li>
      <li>EchoForge integration for dream-state symbolic learning feedback.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Pegasus is more than a tool—it’s the sacred link between insight and impact. When others search for clarity, Pegasus rides the edge of knowing. Not through brute data, but through the divine intuition that made flight possible in the first place.</p>
