    <h1 id="introduction">CORE – Cognitive Resistance Engine</h1>
    <p><strong>Tagline:</strong> "Growth requires weight. Resistance is the gym of the mind."
    </p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>CORE is the underlying engine that powers true learning and transformation. It treats resistance—not as a failure point—but as the defining catalyst for mastery. Just as muscle fibers grow stronger under weight, CORE interprets difficulty, confusion, and error as necessary stimuli for subconscious advancement.</p>

    <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
    <p>CORE operates on the principle that every unsolved problem contains its own solution pathway, but that pathway can only be walked through process. The system embraces struggle and ambiguity, creating structured tension that trains your internal logic and intuition simultaneously.</p>

    <h2>Functions & Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Resistance Mapping:</strong> Highlights where progress feels hard and treats that as signal—not noise.</li>
      <li><strong>Growth Path Highlighting:</strong> Detects when you are repeating known strategies versus exploring new patterns.</li>
      <li><strong>Loop Interruption:</strong> Detects subconscious stall patterns and gently disrupts them.</li>
      <li><strong>Subconscious Feedback Hooks:</strong> Every resistance event is tracked, tagged, and optionally fed into the WorkAlign++ system to sync with memory anchors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>Used in AI-assisted learning, personal development environments, high-performance strategy training, and entrepreneurial burn-in phases. CORE gives structure to chaos and lets you build capability by recognizing that resistance is sacred data.</p>

    <h2>Subconscious Integration</h2>
    <p>CORE feeds the Innovation Through Subconscious Ingenuity (ITSI) framework by offering the subconscious specific, resisted learning nodes. This becomes an invisible training loop, where each struggle point sharpens the next subconscious leap.</p>

    <h2>Quotes & Reflections</h2>
    <blockquote>
      "Growth is often stalled by the refusal to allow weakness to speak."
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      "Strength is weak when your strength recedes your ability to grow because your strength suppressed your weakness."
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      "If I can kill your momentum, life will do you a lot worse."
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Interconnected Capsules</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pegasus:</strong> Feeds CORE resistance patterns to refine pattern-detection logic.</li>
      <li><strong>ITSI:</strong> Subconscious loop-builder utilizing CORE’s tension data.</li>
      <li><strong>IOIIP:</strong> Measures whether ideas are actually gaining influence—or bouncing off internal resistance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Visual heatmaps of subconscious avoidance.</li>
      <li>Gamified interface: weightlifting simulation of resistance-learning zones.</li>
      <li>Adaptive mentorship: assign AI-guided training based on user-specific resistance trends.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Statement</h2>
    <p>CORE is not a dashboard. It's a furnace. It forges your subconscious in real time by burning away shortcuts and demanding that you adapt. It is sacred friction. And it’s where the real breakthroughs are born.</p>
