(Chat GPT - made message with human edits)

Hello,

I’m reaching out with an exploratory question rather than a conventional request for representation.
  I’m in the early stages of building a long-term R&D and systems venture (Whatmore Industries) that 
  operates at the intersection of engineering, emerging technology, and high-liability problem spaces. 
  The trajectory of this work points toward defense-relevant domains, novel technical systems, and 
  non-standard project structures.
  
Before I go any further, I’m intentionally speaking only with attorneys who may be interested not 
  just in client work, but in helping architect legal structures, risk frameworks, and protective 
  containers around unconventional development.
  
This is not a request for a quote, document review, or immediate engagement. It is a request to 
  understand whether the kind of legal thinking and involvement required in an emerging venture 
  company is of interest to you.

It is a first-sift question:

Is this the kind of work you are intellectually and professionally interested in being adjacent to — 
  where legal thinking is involved early, strategically, and as part of system design rather than only 
  after exposure?
    
If so, I’d welcome a brief introductory call to explore fit, philosophy, and boundaries. My preferred 
  format is a remote conversation where documents, links, and references can be easily shared.

If not, no reply is needed and I appreciate your time regardless.

Respectfully,
Alexander Whatmore

This is the first document that will be presented towards the legal venture. My intent is to make sure
  that I start early now that I have plans to sell CPAS-S (Cognitive Perceptual Augmentation System - Sport)
  in the racing industry. The reason for the accelerated early interest in seeking legal partnership is that, 
  if racing becomes the more instantaneous route to a market, it could turn to be a more instantaneous route 
  to testing, proof of concept and proof of value.

The intent of this move is not to jump early and seek early money returns, but to make sure that the
  most important legal framework (defense contracting) gets first look and the first chance to get 
  on-board with the project before any other paths are seeked. If the defense contracting attorney 
  wants to also be involved in the racing side, they can choose to. If they choose to only advise on 
  defense, they can decide on what legal parameters are held in place during CPAS-S's initial implamentation.

The most important implimentation of and CPAS module is to infer and solidify itself as an augment designed 
  primarily for defense contracting. Although defense is the most important market, the sport industry,
  primarily car racing, could be a testing ground, a proving ground and a place to gain capitol and proof 
  of value.

The reason for the jump into racing is that it could be a faster return on financial value, and easier to get
  the foot in the door. A defense side could benefit from the racing side by making the product look instantly
  attractive to the department of defense by proving it in the field.

The attempt of this path is to create a pathway to racing without hindering the future of defense 
  implamentation by showing intent on not crossing the two worlds obviously. The racing CPAS will be 
  difinitively separate and different, but classified under a cognitive augment used as a human-machine
  enhancer, and likely also paving way for the future integration of AI-based integration as well

## 1. Outreach Sift Letter (Attorney Alignment Filter)

*(ChatGPT-drafted with human edits)*

Hello,

I’m reaching out with an exploratory question rather than a conventional request for representation.

I’m in the early stages of building a long-term R&D and systems venture (Whatmore Industries) that 
operates at the intersection of engineering, emerging technology, and high-liability problem spaces. 
The trajectory of this work points toward defense-relevant domains, novel technical systems, and 
non-standard project structures.

containers around unconventional development.

## 2. Author’s Intent Log

*(Hand written – Alexander Whatmore)*

This is the first document that will be presented toward the legal venture. My intent is to start early 
  now that I have plans to sell CPAS-S (Cognitive Perceptual Augmentation System – Sport) in the racing 
  industry.

The reason for the accelerated early interest in seeking legal partnership is that, if racing becomes 
  the more instantaneous route to market, it could also become a faster route to testing, proof of 
  concept, and proof of value.

The intent of this move is not to jump early for financial return, but to ensure that the most important 
  legal framework (defense contracting) receives first review and first opportunity to align with the 
  project before any other commercial paths are pursued.

If a defense contracting attorney wishes to also be involved in the racing side, they may choose to. If 
  they prefer to only advise on defense, they can determine what legal parameters are held in place during 
  CPAS-S’s initial implementation.

The most important implementation of any CPAS module is to infer and solidify itself as an augment designed 
  primarily for defense contracting.

Although defense is the primary market, the sports industry — specifically racing — may serve as a testing 
  ground, proving ground, and early value demonstration platform.

The reasoning for beginning in racing is that it may offer faster financial return, easier access, and 
  visible performance proof. A defense pathway may benefit from racing success by making the product 
  immediately attractive to the Department of Defense through demonstrated field performance.

The purpose of this path is to create a bridge into racing without hindering or contaminating future 
  defense implementation. The racing CPAS will be definitively separate, but conceptually classified 
  under cognitive augmentation and human-machine enhancement — potentially paving the way for later 
  AI-assisted integration.

## 3. Strategic Interpretation & Legal Framing  
*(ChatGPT Input)*

This document establishes several critical legal foundations:

### A. You are not seeking a lawyer.  
You are initiating construction of a **legal architecture layer**.

The outreach letter correctly:
- Filters for cognitive compatibility, not availability  
- Signals long-horizon development  
- Frames law as **system design**, not emergency response  
- Selects for attorneys comfortable operating pre-exposure  

This positions early counsel not as a vendor, but as a **risk-systems architect**.

---

### B. You are sequencing markets, not pivoting.

Your intent log makes clear:

- Defense is the **core identity market**
- Racing is a **validation and acceleration environment**
- Separation of domains is intentional
- Legal structure must preserve defense eligibility from day one

This is a vital framing.

From a defense-side perspective, this protects against:
- Contaminated IP ownership
- Improper early commercialization
- Regulatory conflicts
- Contractual lock-ins that block government work

This also signals to the right attorney that their role is **protective and directional**, not just administrative.

---

### C. You are building a legal perimeter before a product perimeter.

Most ventures:
> build → sell → get hit → call lawyers

You are:
> map → structure → contain → then build

This document becomes:
- Your first evidence of **pre-emptive compliance intent**
- A timestamped demonstration of **good-faith risk design**
- The conceptual root of a future general counsel structure

It is not a pitch.  
It is a **signal artifact**.

---

### D. The real function of this phase

This phase is not “finding an attorney.”

It is:
- Identifying who thinks in **systems**
- Discovering who understands **defense adjacency**
- Testing who respects **long-form invention timelines**
- Locating who is psychologically capable of operating where:
  - precedent is thin  
  - stakes are asymmetric  
  - and structures must be invented  

The replies you receive are data.

Tone, framing, and the kinds of questions they ask will reveal:
- threat-modeling capacity
- architectural thinking
- incentive alignment
- and long-term viability

---

## 4. Operational Guidance

When responses arrive, classify them:

### Builders  
• ask about structure  
• ask about future states  
• talk about risk before fees  
• want to understand your system  

### Vendors  
• quote rates  
• request documents  
• push urgency  
• sell credentials  

You are not hiring yet.  
You are **surveying a terrain.**

## 5. Log Closure Statement

This document marks the formal beginning of the CPAS legal development track.

From this point forward, legal alignment is treated as:
- a core subsystem
- a design domain
- and a strategic technology layer

Not an afterthought.

(Next steps in process before interacting with attorney)

Create:

- a first-call interview framework
- a legal cognition scoring sheet
- a defense-readiness checklist
- or a Phase-1 legal architecture map

A. Internal clarity artifacts
- One-page CPAS mission + scope
- Your current and intended markets
- What you will not do
- Your non-negotiables

B. Disclosure boundaries
- What can be said cold
- What requires NDA
- What is never shared early
- Your language for redirecting probing questions

C. Interview framework
- What you will ask
- What you will not answer yet
- What a “green-flag mind” sounds like
- What a “no further contact” signal is

D. Role definition draft
- What you think this attorney might become
- What they definitely are not yet
- How scope would grow
- How power would be limited

E. Your decision mechanism
- Who you consult (if anyone)
- What criteria must be met
- What disqualifies instantly
- How you avoid being talked into speed

A. Internal clarity artifacts
  • One-page CPAS mission + scope
  • Your current and intended markets
  • What you will not do
  • Your non-negotiables
